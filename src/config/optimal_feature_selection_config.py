ðŸŽ¯ OPTIMAL FEATURE SELECTION CONFIGURATION
Optimized parameters based on analysis of poor performance (RÂ² ~0.3)

Key Issues Identified:
1. Temperature scheduling too aggressive
2. Loss weights not optimized for hyperspectral data
3. Component selection parameters may be too restrictive
4. Validation-based optimization not properly configured

This configuration addresses these issues with data-driven parameter tuning.
